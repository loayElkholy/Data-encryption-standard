# Data-encryption-standard

DES is a block cipher and encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bit each, means 64 bits of plain text goes as the input to DES, which produces 64 bits of cipher text. The same algorithm and key are used for encryption and decryption, with minor differences. The key length is 56 bits.

to run program 
1)git clone "repo link"

2)g++ main.cpp -o main.exe

3)./main.exe "option{encrypt or decrypt}" "message" "key"
